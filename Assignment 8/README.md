Option 0: Updating Assignment 8
Peer feedback:
• Peers liked the hover animation but had varied opinions on how it had been implemented. Some thought that it created too much motion among adjacent images and might cause cognitive overload.
• Needed to update the works from solid images to interactive elements.
• Could consider aligning the color scheme across the website, as well as with the resume.
Changes:
• Adjusted home page cover animation
• Added a text box for inputting comment
• Revised work 2 for extra interactive features
• Added an about page with entry animation
• Adjusted the color scheme for resume
